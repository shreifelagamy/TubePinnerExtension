# TubePinnerExtension

A lot of times I face a problem where I was watching a tutorial on youtube or udemy and there are some code samples,
so i have to puse the video to write the code and then return back again to complete the video.

So I thought why can't I make an extension where it make the video float over anything and remain with me while coding and
trying the code. From this problem this solution came to me.

I searched for extensions, I found some put I didnot found one that support udemy. So i started creating one and here I'm.

# Installation 

  - Download the source from git by clicking the **download button** on top right or using `git clone <repo_link>`
  - Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
    - The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, 
      hovering over **More Tools** then selecting **Extensions**.
  - Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to **Developer mode**.
  - Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the extension directory.

# Notes

 This extension needs another chrome application and you will find it also on my repo <LINK>.
 This whole thing (the extension and the application) still under development
